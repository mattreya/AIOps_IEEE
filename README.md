The purpose of this repo is two fold:

1.) It underscores how I use Agile methods to produce tangible results using a bot and denoting the day I had conversations with a given bot. In this example, I used Google's Gemini-cli. Note how each time I work with the bot, a reader can track what 
input is from the user and what input is from the author. 
2.) This is the basic methodology of building a core set of skills that evolved over 27 years that I spent that frankly, took 27 seconds for the bot to figure out.
3.) Co-authorship in IEEE is most likely frowned upon at this moment in time. Of all the stuff I've seen on the internet and LinkedIn, it's important to denote how a human drives innovation and the bot facilitates the busy work of making this document:
    a. IEEE compliant
    b. reommend WHICH magazines to publish to. 
        EDITORS: If you wish to publish, you may do so with proper credit for myself and Google's Gemini-cli.
4.) The deeper material in HOW a person learns to work with the bot is the subject of my upcoming website designed to train new learners on the 3 pilars: 1.) Network Fundamentals, 2.) Cybersecurity and 3.) IT Operations using various Sandboxes.

It is my hope you enjoy this article. It's brief and to the point and incorporates things that have already been worked on with humans. Now bots will accelerate and free a person to leave the confines of developer silos in organizations and with 
this structure go wild on fun and inventive tools that have not been thought of before. 

Happy Hunting!
